                        We understand that the majority of our subscribers don’t follow all eight European leagues as closely as we do and that for many subscribers, Underdog Analytica could be their entry into the sports gambling scene. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or first-timer, here is a quick course on football (soccer) betting using Underdog Analytica.
                        Football matches can end in one of three ways: home team wins, away team wins, or a draw (scores equal). After 90’ + added time (determined by time used on injuries or goal celebrations), the match is over and the end result is finalized. The European football season lasts roughly 40 weeks from September to June.
